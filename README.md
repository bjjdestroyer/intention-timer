# 2005 FE Mod 1- Intention Timer (Group Project)
## Project Description
This project represents the collaborative efforts of Taryn Martin, Joe Varela, and Jake West. This is our first group project for the first module of the Turing Front End Program (Cohort 2005). We were asked to build an Intention Timer application that allows users to set time-boxed goals related to wellness & productivity. In practice, users select a category, describe a specific activity they want to complete, and use the built in timer to track their progress. By utilizing local storage, we *should* be able to provide the user with information about their behaviors over time.

As a group, we had to build this application from scratch! We were provided with static comp images for the entire site, as well as a color palette and font family. We were responsible for building the general HTML framework, applying CSS styling to it, and connecting this to our own JavaScript files to enable functionality. This project was broken into multiple iterations, each with unique requirements. The functionality we successfully built includes:
  1. Design layout with HTML and CSS
  2. Utilize an activity class in JavaScript
  3. Create a form in HTML to take in user input
  4. Construct a count down timer
  5. Display count down timer & user input
## Learning Goals
At the beginning of this project, we outlined a number of learning goals to act as our "guiding star" through this project. These are as follows:
  1. Gain a better understanding of writing clean and concise HTML & CSS
  2. Understand how Grid and Flex-Box can enhance responsivity
  3. Synthesize a working product from all the pieces (DOM, Data Model, JS, CSS & HTML) we've come across this module
  4. Develop our skills working and communicating as a group

## Project Screenshots
1. Our wire-framed version of the website. We found that mapping out the wire frame with high detail gave us a stronger understanding of the html framework and css styling that needed to unfold.
